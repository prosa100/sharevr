Basicly, the latancy bad. So let's get rid of it down.


Although I can do the distortion on the gpu, I don't know how they give me this data, so I will not.
Bascily, I have a problem becuse the data bounces around alot before it gets to me.
I rather have an acync event that gets the

Frame rate. I want to run at 120hz, but 60/90 proably fine.

how do i get the cleaned up images?

can use voxel and probilities of color

render to a cube map, no clear.

### Filtering
The new, long-range camera has filtering built in, but I can do my own fopr close range
The shadow can be computed and filled with flat.
All done on the gpu?

### todo.
Get rid of the gear vr.
Unrelated note: Chrome remote desktop works perfectly from the lab.
